# Working on the Repo:
We will have a fork called 'dev'. When you clone the repo use git branch to make your own branch of the dev, called 'devName' (name being your name). We can then use pull requests to merge your dev brainch to the main dev branch. Once we're ready for a major update we can merge the dev branch to the main branch, and use that branch to do a build.
