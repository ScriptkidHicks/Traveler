Traveler
A solution to the Traveling Salesman problem as a web app marketed towards small companies to help them optimize their daily delivery routes, using the Google maps API.
Companies can use our software to calculate the quickest route from their starting address to up to 10 other destinations that they need to go. After entering their addresses, users will be directed to a page from which they will be able to see and interact with a map that has displayed the most optimal route to each of the destinations and back to their starting point. 
NOTE: The map cannot calculate non-existent points, nor can it calculate distance between points which are not drivable from each other. The page will be loading forever if addresses are not valid or within drivable distance of each other.
